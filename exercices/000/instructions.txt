Hello World
===========

Introduces: print, strings.

Print "Hello World", using the print() function.

Using command line, I want to see:

julien@localhost$ python exo-00.py
Hello World
julien@localhost$

So your program will emit a new line after the last letter, otherwise I'll see:

julien@localhost$ python exo-00.py
Hello Worldjulien@localhost$

And I don't like it !!

But don't worry, print() will handle the output of the new-line
character, it's cool.
