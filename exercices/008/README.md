# Characters counting

Introduces: len, strings, list.

## Instructions

Write a script named `solution.py` that prints the number of characters in `paragraph`.

You must copy the following in your script:

```python
paragraph = """Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The
taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in
dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly
battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to
the small planet of Naboo. While the congress of the Republic
endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme
Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of
peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict"""
```
