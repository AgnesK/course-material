Basic loop
==========

Introduces: for.

By typing print only once in your source code, make Python print
"Hello world !" vertically.

In other words, I want :

print('H')
print('e')
print('l')
print('l')
print('o')
print(' ')
print('w')
print('o')
print('r')
print('l')
print('d')
print(' ')
print('!')

BUT I want you to use a "for" construct instead of manually repeating
"print", "print", "print", "print"... Guess what ? I used a "for" to
produce the previous ugly list of "print, print, print, print" ;-)
