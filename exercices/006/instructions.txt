Simple list
===========

Introduces: list.

Print the list ["Hello world", 42], using the print() function.

Notice that I'm not asking to print the string '["Hello world", 42]',
(composed of 18 chars), but the list containing a string an a number.

But don't worry, print() will understand your list, and will display a
friendly version of it. Python works for you, you're not working for
Python.
