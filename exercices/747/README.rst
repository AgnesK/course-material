Given the energie.csv dataset given in this exercices you will have to show us your datamining and analytical skill to produce a csv report of the french energy consumption in 2013.

* First step: Mine the data!

Following the example.csv file, 
you will have produce a **clean** csv file that give the energy consumption of France by month with:
- ENR consumption
- Non ENR consumption
- CO2 emissions
- Total of energy consumption

Take a look at ''csv'' module

* Second step: Analyse correlations!
Produce a specic csv file with the repartition of means of consumption of non ENR 

* Third step: Visualize it!
Show use the correlation between energy consumption and CO2 emissions creating a graph by month.
Using pyplot module of matpotlib produce a graph of energy consumption by month with the repartition by type of production 

* Fourth step:
Give us a prediction for global consumption for January, February and March of 2014 and the consumption of CO2
